## Overview       

These tutorials introduce step-by-step methods, software, and tools used to create, visualize, and standardize netCDF files to archive ready formats. The netCDF file format is a recommended format for archival and distribution of multi-dimensional and gridded geospatial data. In the tutorials presented here, daily geoTIFF files are converted to a single multidimensional netCDF file that follows Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions. Separate tutorials exist demonstrating command line utilities as well as popular programming software are demonstrated.
